# Indentations
* Expand tabs into spaces.

# Formatting
* It's inspired by C coding style in the Linux Kernel but we code in C++ in this project.

```C++
#include <iostream>

/*
 ** Description Line

class eftGoodThing {
  private:
    byte* data; /* stick the asterisk to the type */
    char* str;
    int *pointer_a, *pointer_b; /* unless in such occasions */
    time_t time;
    vector<pair<double, double, double>> listOfPairs;

    void my_func(int& io_val, int* out_len, char** out_buf);

    void request_response(void);
  public:
    struct SomeEntity {
      bool condition; /* some comments */
      int important_var;
    } fl;

    struct OtherEntity {
      static bool condition = false; /* some comments */
      static int importantVar = 1;
    } fl;

    void clean_up(time_t time, int param);
  protected:
};

void eftGoodThing::request_response(void) {
  switch(variable) {
    case a:
      run_func();
    break;
    case b:
      do_nothing();
    default:
    break;
  }
  return;
}

int eftGoodThing::clean_up(time_t time, int param) {
  if (!file) {
    for(;;) {
      break;
    }
    return OK;
  }
  return NOK;
}

namespace mySpace {
  typedef enum {
    EN_STATIC,
    EN_CACHED,
    EN_CONTINUOUS
  } aModel;

  #define EVENT_INTEGER       'd'
  #define EVENT_FLOAT         'f'
}
```

* Proto files:
```
message EcdhBenchmarkTableReply {
  int32 no_secrets = 1;
  int32 duration = 2;
  int32 rate = 3; /* Secret key per seconds */
}
```

# File and directory naming
* Only Linux style file/directory naming. For example: codeing_convention blockchain/ config.cpp
    eft_serivces/ dev_notes.txt
    - Avoid file or directory naming such as MyImportanFile.cpp or SomeDir/ or "Program File/".

# Header file organizations
* Ensure that every header file \#includes all other necessary headers or forward-declarations
  necessary for independent compilation.
* No "everything_in_here" header file. For example "global.h". They make big troubles down the road!
* Put a set of related (and interdependent) functionality into a single file.
* Prefer forward declaration over \#includes whenever possible. This allows you to break the cyclic
  header dependencies.
* Separate your public interface from your private implementation at the filesystem level.
  Use include/ and src/ subdirectories, where include/ has all of your public headers, and src/ has
  all of your sources and private headers. It will help us in the future when we need to make libraries.


# Exception
* Sometimes there are files or codes that are generated by source generators such as gRPC or 
Google Protobuf etc. In this case do not maniuplate the style or naming conventions of those 
externaly generated files. Just include and use them as advised.
